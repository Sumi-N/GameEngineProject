Since I didn't use any Matrix Vector multiplication in my collision system (I am using rotation(yaw) to tranlate to the other cordination system),
I have made an inverse unit test script and while looping the unit test to see how fast it becomes after putting the intrinsic orders. Below is the result.

It gets 10% percent faster when it is an intrinsic function

Meanwhile, when I made Vector3 Vector3 addition, it rather became slower

and I don't know why.
